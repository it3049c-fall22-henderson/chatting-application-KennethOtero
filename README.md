- [x] submit the repository link on Canvas

## Self-Evaluation:

How many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 

I'd say 17/20 points. When I ran 'npm test', I noticed that it was skipping some tests (app-logic specifically). 
So until that test suite is fixed I'm not really sure where this lab stands in terms of grading. I tried
my best to make sure the content in the index.js file lined up with the assignment instructions.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I've always wondered how chatting applications worked so it's cool to catch a glimpse into the functionality of one.
This lab also introduced me to JSON, which I appreciate. I'm looking forward to the chatting application assignment next.

### How long it took me to finish this?
I worked on this a little bit over the afternoon, but in total I'd probably say an hour.


## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
The Bootstrap 'display-4' class is Bootstrap's way to display different sized headings.
