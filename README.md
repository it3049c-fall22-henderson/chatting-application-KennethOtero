## Self-Evaluation:

How many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 

Module 5:
I'd say 17/20 points. When I ran 'npm test', I noticed that it was skipping some tests (app-logic specifically). 
So until that test suite is fixed I'm not really sure where this lab stands in terms of grading. I tried
my best to make sure the content in the index.js file lined up with the assignment instructions.

Module 6:

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
Module 5:
I've always wondered how chatting applications worked so it's cool to catch a glimpse into the functionality of one.
This lab also introduced me to JSON, which I appreciate. I'm looking forward to the chatting application assignment next.

Module 6:

### How long it took me to finish this?
Module 5:
